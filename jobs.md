## About npm

npm, Inc. maintains the _npm_ package manager for JavaScript and hosts the world’s largest software registry. Our technology has been embraced by millions of developers worldwide for client- and server-side applications as diverse as IoT, mobile development, financial services, and aerospace. More than 30,000 companies, including the BBC, DocuSign, IBM, SiriusXM, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm’s products and services to reduce developer friction and build amazing things.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that __the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another.__

We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

[Our offices][offices] are in Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental, and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
